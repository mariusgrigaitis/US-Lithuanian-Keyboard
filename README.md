# US-Lithuanian-Keyboard

Why?
====

Switching between US and Lithuanian keyboards is pain. Especially when you need to type numbers, etc.

In Ubuntu there's a keyboard layout named Lithuanian (US keyboard with Lithuanian letters).
The layout works by assigning Lithuanian letters to upper row (numbers) with Alt key
